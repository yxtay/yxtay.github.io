Hi, my name is YuXuan Tay, a Data Scientist from Singapore.
I am a Google Cloud Certified Professional Data Engineer.

I build end-to-end machine learning systems to make business impact.
This includes engineering data transformation pipelines, model development,
model training scheduling, model serving, deployment and monitoring.

My experience in the data science field started in 2014
and has spanned across industries such as government, consulting, 
startup, insurance, ecommerce, travel and logistics.
This has given me professional experience on data science domains
such as topic modelling, text classification, uplift modelling, ranking,
dynamic personalised recommendation and visual model explanations.
I have also developed models for text generation
and embedding learning with matrix factorisation.
I am familiar with deep learning techniques in domains
such as natural language processing, computer vision
and recommendation engines.

I graduated from National University of Singapore with a degree in
Bachelor of Science, 1st Class Honours in Statistics.
I was the valedictorian for the Statistics Class of 2014.

Outside of work, I enjoy keeping fit with calisthenics workouts and jogging,
following Formula 1, mountain hiking, exploring scenery and travelling.
